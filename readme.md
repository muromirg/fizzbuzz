## FIZZBUZZ

This project contains the FIZZBUZZ function, which:
1) Takes the string with numbers, divided by spaces, as input
2) Returns the string with these numbers too, BUT:
	- ".. any number divisible by three is replaced by the word fizz 
	   and any divisible by five by the word buzz. 
	   Numbers divisible by both become fizz buzz" -- As [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) said.

Project can be built using bash and g++-7 compiler.

To build: 
- open bash in the project folder
- make 	    -- builds program main.out, which takes a string with numbers as argv[] parameters;
- make test -- builds test program test.out, which runs some unit tests.

Also, project is connected with travis CI system, can be found [here](https://travis-ci.org/muromirg/acronis_term6).
